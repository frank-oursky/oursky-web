          Behind a well-performing, eye-catching, and award-winning mobile or web application is its tech stack:
          technologies, programming languages, tools, and software that the app is built on. Their synergy is the
          foundation of your project and will influence the future of your digital product. Oursky has the experience,
          capabilities, and expertise to pick the right combination of tech stack that will be the underlying elements
          of your project.
