          Oursky worked with <a href="http://www.asos.com/" target="_blank">ASOS</a> to create a custom browsing
          experience where
          4,000 new items are published weekly.

        <h5>The Need: A tailored fast-fashion shopping experience</h5>

        <p>
          ASOS, one of the largest global online retail stores, sells over 75,000 designer and private-label clothes and
          accessories through localized mobile and web experiences in almost every country in the world. To further
          enrich their users’ shopping experience, they wanted to create an app that can help customers browse new
          arrivals — 4,000 products are added weekly.
        </p>
        <p>
          ASOS worked with Oursky to create an iOS app that would showcase a daily feed of all the store’s new items.
          ASOS wanted to provide something more than just an app — they envisioned a mobile experience that would excite
          on-the-go customers when scrolling for updates.
        </p>

        <h5>
          Oursky’s Strategy: Develop a customer-centric mobile browsing experience integrated into enterprise APIs
        </h5>
        <p>Oursky began working on ASOS' product by creating a proof-of-concept iOS app. We created the “NEW IN” ASOS
          daily feed that could showcase the 4,000 new items that ASOS brings in every week.</p>
        <p>For the front end, we focused on a customer-centric user interface (UI) that had prominent catalogue images,
          smooth swiping animations, and convenient features like enabling users to share content on social media. We
          used Objective-C for iOS and integrated it into ASOS’ backend APIs. In our integrations, we included features,
          such as letting users save items for later purchase, in ASOS’ desktop and mobile sites. We also designed the
          app to capture behavioral data so ASOS can better understand customer preferences and serve content or items
          that they may be interested in.</p>

        <h5>Results: Seamless, on-the-go shopping experience</h5>

        <p>
          Oursky delivered an on-demand app solution that met ASOS’ requirements. Through concerted effort from our
          development teams, we created an app whose features were seamlessly integrated into ASOS’ own backend, giving
          their shoppers more convenience. After the app’s pilot release in the U.K. and Denmark, ASOS rolled out the
          “NEW IN” app globally.

            The Oursky team has been great to work with. They provided accurate estimates on the work required and
            always delivered on time despite the time difference and location. The cross-team communication was always
            effective. Their organized approach to the product development and on-hand support when issues arose were
            brilliant and I’d definitely recommend and work with them again.
