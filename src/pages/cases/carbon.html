        <h3 class="text-center">Oursky worked with <a href="https://lavatools.co/" target="_blank">Lavatools</a> in
          designing mobile apps that can be smoothly paired with internet-of-things (IoT) devices.</h3>

        <h5>The Need: A mobile software that integrates with professional-grade hardware
        </h5>

        <p>
          Cooking hardware company Lavatools brought food thermometers into the 21st century with ultra-high accuracy
          sensors, magnetic backs and stands, Bluetooth capabilities, and illuminated displays. But they wanted to go
          further: They envisioned a thermometer that can assist chefs by sending notifications to another device chefs
          also use constantly — the smartphone. Lavatools already had the professional-grade hardware, and they needed
          mobile software that could help chefs and food enthusiasts set alarms, create recipe libraries, and concoct
          their own cooking settings. Lavatools initially engaged Oursky for a design project, but after it began,
          Lavatools decided to work with Oursky for app development.
        </p>

        <h5>Oursky’s Strategy: Design an app for smart thermometer</h5>
        <p>
          Oursky’s design team worked with Lavatools’ sample user stories to develop a user flow, wireframe, mockup, and
          clickable prototype. The work focused on a modern interface that answers the needs of professional chefs but
          is still user-friendly enough for home cooks and foodies to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the design phase, we created an iOS app that uses Bluetooth technology to connect to a proprietary, IoT
          food thermostat that tracks cooking temperature. The app takes information from the smart device to precisely
          calculate the time left for cooking given a temperature reading. Afterward, we continued working with an
          Android version of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech stack used for this project included Bluetooth LTE, Objective C for iOS, and Java for Android.
        </p>

        <h5>The Result: A feature-packed digital food thermometer</h5>

        <p>
          Our work with Lavatools proved how bluetooth technology and hardware integration can still be a work of art —
          for foodies and chefs alike. Lavatools’ products have received 4+ star reviews on Amazon from over 3,000 users
          and has been featured in publications such as <a
