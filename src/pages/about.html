        <p>
          Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but
          because it is fun to program, said Linus Torvalds. We love coding and we code beautifully.

        <p>
          User experience (UX) is one of the most important aspects in an app. We take it seriously through solid
          research and metrics to find out what’s the best for the end users.

        <p>
          Oursky isn't just another app design and development agency. We are passionate digital craftsmen and
          craftswomen who continuously build and reinvent quality products, and create seamless and immersive digital
          experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to deliver on our promise, we recognize the need to lay the right groundwork: People have to feel at
          home, bring their best selves to work, and take complete ownership of their projects. We don't just believe it
          — our company is fueled by the uniqueness and diversity as well as excellence of our team members. We believe
          in creating digital products that solve real-life problems, cater to users, and help communities across the
          world. And yes, we also believe that having office cats, coffee, ping pong tables, whisky — and whatever else
          that will make our team members feel at home — will help us do that.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of our founders are technical powerhouses, and we have team members who have moved on to — or returned
          from — top-tier Silicon Valley companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. We contribute to <a

            Test for better
            coding</a>, which means our web and mobile development process includes source control, continuous builds,
          detailed issue tracking, a QA team, a strict interview process, and code reviews by peers and tech leads.
