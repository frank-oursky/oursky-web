							<h4>Modernize your Infrastructure</h4>
							<p class="text--bold">Microservices &amp; Containerization</p>
							<p>
								Not only does Microservices improve the scalability and resilience of your applications,
								it also allows you to outsource server development work more easily when you are
								under-resourced as services are loosely coupled and communication between services are
								conducted over well-defined APIs.
