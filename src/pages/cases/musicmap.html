        <h5>The Need: An online platform for music teachers and students to awaken their passion for music

        </h5>

        <p>
          Music makes people come together, regardless of your background. That’s what Hallace Yiu had in mind when he
          came up with <a href="https://musicmap.hk/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MusicMap</a>. Hallace, who
          teaches guitar
          playing, found it challenging to sign students up. In Hong Kong, most music teachers reach out to students
          through music centers. These venues, however, drive a hard bargain: They usually charge 50% or more of the
          tuition fees as commissions.
        </p>

        <p>
          While there were already platforms that tried to match instructors to students, they didn’t provide room for
          teachers to fully express their artistry and philosophy in music and teach it to their would-be students. To
          help his fellow music teachers, he envisaged an online platform that helps connect music connoisseurs and
          enthusiasts so they can share their passion for music.
        </p>

        <h5>Oursky’s Strategy: Create a web application with intuitive user experience
        </h5>
        <p>
          Hallace partnered with Oursky to bring his ideas into fruition. As an artist, Hallace spoke through ideas. He
          envisioned MusicMap as an auditorium for learners and maestros alike to come together and find joy in
          creating, playing, and listening to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oursky visualized these ideas into iconography and code. Oursky’s project manager and developers brainstormed
          with Hallace into creating a mockup of a web app that includes not only the matching and <a
            href="https://musicmap.hk/en/tuning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">piano tuning</a> services, but also a
          feed of
          interesting music-related events across Hong Kong that MusicMap’s subscribers can attend, like <a
            href="https://musicmap.hk/en/events/workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workshops</a>, <a
            href="https://musicmap.hk/en/events/concert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concerts</a>, and even <a
            href="https://musicmap.hk/en/events/contest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contests</a>, to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the mockups were finalized, Oursky’s project manager implemented and broke down tasks to man-day units
          and organized them into bi-weekly sprints. Hallace was always involved in the process, ensuring that he
          understands what’s going on despite not having a technical background.
        </p>

        <h5>The Result: An online venue for everyone to find joy in learning and making music
        </h5>

        <p>
          MusicMap has since become the go-to online educational platform for music teachers across Hong Kong to
          advertise their tutorial services. For students, MusicMap boasts having teachers whose expertise span more
          than 20 musical instruments and music theories.

            I am impressed with Oursky’s attention to detail — from the website’s flow down to subtleties of the icons.
            The team was very proactive in involving me throughout the whole journey. And despite my lack of technical
            background, I saw that Oursky was able to balance that fine line between user experience and design — just
            like how we make music.
