        <h4>IoT Development</h4>
        <p>
          Most connected hardware and internet-of-things (IoT) products communicate with mobile devices via Bluetooth®,
          Wi-Fi, and ultrasound. Our team has the expertise in integrating these protocols in applications. See how we

        <h4>Security with DevOps</h4>
        <p>
          Our DevSecOps philosophy allows us to bake security early into the development lifecycle. We build digital
          products that comply to the standards of the EU General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), Open Web Application
          Security Project (OWASP), and Payment Card Industry (PCI-DSS), among others.
