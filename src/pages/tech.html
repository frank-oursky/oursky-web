          Behind a well-performing, eye-catching, and award-winning mobile or web application is its tech stack:
          technologies, programming languages, tools, and software that the app is built on. Their synergy is the
          foundation of your project and will influence the future of your digital product. Oursky has the experience,
          capabilities, and expertise to pick the right combination of tech stack that will be the underlying elements
          of your project.

        <h4>IoT Development</h4>
        <p>
          Most connected hardware and internet-of-things (IoT) products communicate with mobile devices via Bluetooth®,
          Wi-Fi, and ultrasound. Our team has the expertise in integrating these protocols in applications. See how we
          made a cooking thermometer connected — and <a href="{{root}}cases/carbon">smarter</a>.

        <h4>Security with DevOps</h4>
        <p>
          Our DevSecOps philosophy allows us to bake security early into the development lifecycle. We build digital
          products that comply to the standards of the EU General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), Open Web Application
          Security Project (OWASP), and Payment Card Industry (PCI-DSS), among others.

        <h4>Payment Gateways</h4>
        <p>
          The Payment feature is a cornerstone of online commerce. We have solid experience in designing user-friendly
          checkout flows and integrating major payment gateways.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a project we worked with the largest car park management company in Hong Kong to integrate 8+ payment
          gateways in the app.

        <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
        <p>
          We have developed and apply various ML model to solve business problems, such as predicting NBA game result,
          image / object recognition, optimizing recommendation engine, or predict retail stores cannibalization.
